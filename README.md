# Covid19tracker
This web based Covid19 tracker is developed using API of covid19india.org - https://api.covid19india.org/ <br />
Using that API, I have created my 2 APIs and then the data is being fetched to the website. <br />
Using this webapp, you can get latest count of covid cases in India. <br />
Apart from this, It has some graphs shown. It has also statewise data. <br />
You can get some useful links which will be helpful of covid patients. <br />

Some screenshots are there..
